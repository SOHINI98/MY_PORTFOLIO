# MY_PORTFOLIO
I am a DATA SCIENCE enthusiast. A few of my sample works is here.

LIVE PROJECT 1 - Covid 19 Forecasting Data using Machine Learning Algorithms
Exploratory data analysis of the Covid data- both world wide and in India. Understanding the growth patterns in the number of cases, worst affected countries, position of India. Drilled down to India analysis of number of cases based on sex, age and geographical location. Finally using machine learning and deep learning algorithms to find out which is the best model to predict the near future scenario accurately.

Sigmoid Model turned out to be a best fit and predict the exact date when we can expect to see a fall in the number of active covid cases in India. Other models used where LSTM, Support Vector Regression, ARIMA model, Linear Regression, Facebook prophet model.

LIVE PROJECT 2 - Twitter data Analysis
To find out if covid 19 has an impact on mental health issues faced by people. Data scraped from Twitter API. Other analysis done are Topic Modelling (using Latent Dirilect Allocation) and sentiment analysis (polarity)

LIVE PROJECT 3 - Estimation of Sales of Walmart Retail goods
Used Data Visualization in Tableau for exploratory data analysis after Feature Engineering, Data Cleaning. ÔÅ∂ Applied Predictive Analytics ARIMA Model, Support Vector Regression in Python to build a forecasting model to predict sales for the upcoming months

LIVE PROJECT 4 - Used ARMA and ARIMA model to predict sales of omlettes in a hospital and predict number of air passengers in the upcoming months respectively. Analysis was done by applying a lot of data scaling and cleaning procedures liike logarithmic transformation, exponential decay etc. Also detrending and deseasonaling of the data was done to ensure that the models are being run on stationary data.

LIVE PROJECT 5 - Used Natural Language Processing Techniques to find meaningful insights from different comedian's speech. Data was gathered through web scrapping using Beautiful Soup Library. Data Clelaning done by removing URL, tokenisation, stopword removal, lemmatization. Coming to the main analysis, it included word cloud generation, topic modeling, sentiment analysis - both polarity and subjectivity, finding the count of unique words etc. 

LIVE PROJECT 6 - SQL PROJECT Building a database for a service based private company - Forensic Investigation and Consultancy Services 
A basic approach to handle data from multiple departments and how to link them  is represented here. The database file is uploaded. Also a powerpoint presentation is uploaded for better visuals. Data considered is dummy and absolutely random. No involvement of the company mentioned is there.

LIVE PROJECT 7 - Logistic Regression 
Performed a logistic regression model on the iconic titanic data set, to predict the survival rate of passengers basedon their age, sex, family members, number of points and boarding point. Feature Engineering is the key highlight of this project. The model gives very high accuracy to predict only when proper data cleaning is done. 

LIVE PROJECT - 8  Stock Data Analysis
Finding out the key performance indicators of different stocks and comparing it with the Nifty Values as a standard. This project aims to find out usful metrices like mean returns, volume of stocks, ATR, alpha and beta value of each stock. These values are the key factors that has to be kept in mind while investing in a stock. Regression model is used to find out the alpha and beta values of a stock. Another key element of this project is the calculation of drawdown period. This is one of the most important yet ignored data that investors must be aware of.
